## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This laboratory exercise addresses three critical pillars of AI ethics:
- **Bias Detection**: Identifying gender-based discrimination in loan approval models
- **Fairness Enhancement**: Implementing techniques to mitigate algorithmic bias
- **Privacy Protection**: Evaluating the impact of removing personally identifiable information (PII)

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, students will be able to:

- Identify and quantify bias in machine learning models
- Implement resampling techniques to address dataset imbalance
- Evaluate model fairness across different demographic groups
- Understand the trade-offs between model performance and privacy protection
- Apply ethical AI principles in practical scenarios

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

**Synthetic Loan Approval Dataset**
- 100 synthetic loan application records
- Features: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, etc.
- Target: Loan Approval Status (Y/N)
- Purpose: Educational use to demonstrate ethical AI concepts
